            <hr class = "InBlockLine">
            <h4 class = "Name_Style" style = font-size:19px> The current meta of CS2 weapons </h4>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                Due to the CS2 purchase menu update, choosing guns before a match is an important stage of preparation. Now you won't be able to take the whole arsenal with you. Instead, you need to choose 4 pistols, 5 PP or shotguns and 5 rifles. There is not enough space for everyone, and therefore only the best guns should be included in the purchase. Let's see which weapons are the strongest in CS2 right now and what is better to play with.
            </p>

            <hr class = "InBlockLine">
            <h4 class = "Name_Style" style = font-size:19px> Rifles: AK-47, M4A1-S and AUG </h4>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                Rifles have always been the backbone of the CS arsenal. They provide the best balance between firepower, accuracy and mobility. The most preferred rifles are the AK-47 for attack and the M4A1-S for defense. Although the M4A1-S was indirectly weakened by the new smoke grenade system, it still prevails over the M4A4. By the way, M4A4 is now actively using about a third of the players, so the rifle can also be considered part of the meter guns.
            </p>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                There is also room in the meta for rifles with a scope. AUG is deservedly popular with defensive players. However, the pros began to pay much less attention to this gun. Perhaps this will change by the time of the first major in CS2. The AUG is a more expensive but also cooler rifle compared to the M4. Higher accuracy, comparable damage at any distance and the presence of a sight are weighty arguments in favor of buying AUG, if everything is OK with the economy.
            </p>

            <hr class = "InBlockLine">
            <h4 class = "Name_Style" style = font-size:19px> Sniper Rifles: AWP </h4>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                Nothing has changed in the country of sniper rifles. AWP is still considered the best sniper rifle. The ability to send the enemy to respawn with one shot covers all the disadvantages of the gun. A tiny shop, high price, low movement speed do not matter when the principle of "one shot– one corpse" works.
            </p>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                In rounds with a weak economy, snipers were also given no alternative. You can only buy SSG 08. Fortunately, five purchase slots allow you to take two sniper rifles and three automatic rifles, so both sides can afford a fairly wide range of weapons. Automatic sniper rifles, by tradition, turned out to be overboard. They still can't compete with AWP.
            </p>

            <hr class = "InBlockLine">
            <h4 class = "Name_Style" style = font-size:19px> Pistols: Desert Eagle, P250 and TEC-9 </h4>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                Among pistols, the situation has not changed at all. With the new system, you can place several alternative guns in the purchase menu at the same time, for example, CZ-75a and TEC-9, but there is no point in this. The fact is that it is a choice without a choice. The Desert Eagle is obviously better than a revolver, and the TEC-9 is cooler than the CZ-75a. Therefore, in the new game, players are left with the same sets of pistols: starter, P250 for purchase in defense, TEC-9 for purchase in attack and Desert Eagle for those who are confident in their shooting.
            </p>

            <hr class = "InBlockLine">
            <h4 class = "Name_Style" style = font-size:19px> Shotguns and PP: MAG-7 and XM1014, MAC-10 and MP9 </h4>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                Little has changed in the new category, which combined submachine guns, shotguns and heavy weapons. The main news is XM1014. Recently, in CS matches:GO this shotgun attracted the attention of esports players. For example, the player Natus Vincere is s1mple. The automatic shotgun really deserves a place in the CS2 purchase menu.
            </p>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                In addition, MAG-7 should be added to the purchase of protection. This cheap and very powerful shotgun can help in short-range defense. The remaining slots can be filled with anything, the main thing is not to miss the two best PP – MAC-10 and MP9. They have long and firmly occupied the role of workhorses in the second round of attack and defense, respectively.
            </p>
            <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
                The redesign of the purchase menu in CS2 has set a new task for the players. On the one hand, it is now possible to have several alternatives at the same time. The ability to freely change the M4A4 and M4A1-S has been requested since the appearance of the latter, and finally it happened! On the other hand, 15 guns fit into the purchase menu, and there are more than 30 of them in the game. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately determine which firearm will "pass the casting", and which one will gather dust in the inventory.
