            I’ve played PUBG for 3300 hours, and in case you don’t know how PUBG was back then, let me remind you that the game only featured the third person, and Tommy Gun used to be a create gun.
        </p>
        <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
            Besides, you’re also stuck with the third person, and it was very heroic of someone to run the game stable. All these things changed dramatically when Bluehole implemented Update 1.0, which brought along many weapons, items, and, most importantly – Sanhok.

        <h4 class = "Name_Style" style = font-size:19px> PUBG Best Weapons And Tier List </h4>
        <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
            Our PUBG Weapon Tier List will be categorized on two bases. Firstly, I will look at how powerful the weapon is and how the stats compare to the rivals. In addition, the authority factor over other guns will also be considered.
        </p>
        <p class = "TermsOfUseStyle">
            To illustrate the results, I won’t put P911 above AK-47 because it could be handy; the meta is simple: no one would pick P911 over AK-47, so the dominance of weapons is going to facilitate the rankings. Lastly, tier lists are subjective, so don’t bother changing them if you are comfortable with a certain weapon. My guide will also enlighten some key ideas behind most weapons that might be useful for new players.
