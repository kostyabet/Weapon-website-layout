                The site has a huge amount of useful information, which we are kindly ready to share with you. 
                <br><br>
                There is a <a href = "../doctype.html" style = color:#ecc758> FAQ </a> tab where you can ask your question or view frequently asked questions.
                <br><br>
                On the <a href = "../characteristics/characteristics.html" style = color:#ecc758> Characteristics </a> tab you can see the characteristics of different weapons from different games. 
                The list of games is updated as quickly as possible.
                If any characteristics have been changed by game developers, please let us know.
                We try to update the specifications as quickly as possible, but we do not always succeed perfectly.
                <br><br>
                On the <a href = "#" style = color:#ecc758> Skins </a> tab you can find different skins that have ever existed in a particular game. The update conditions are still the same. 
                If you see a skin that has not been added to the game, then quickly inform us about it and we will do everything.
                <br><br><br><br>
                In general, this entire project was written by one person and for a very long time.
                <br>
                It all started back in 2019, when a seventh grader decided to write his own website and, in general, created a fairly voluminous database for this site. And it all ended today. 
                When I was already a first-year student I decided to finish off this childhood project. Just to amuse your soul)
